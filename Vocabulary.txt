Event     A difference between a sample and the reference genome; usually a 
          SNP or an SNV.

Genotype  the genotype (0/0, 0/1, 5/78 or whatever indicates which allele(s) a
          sample is supposed to have, the reference allele being numbered 0,
          the (different) alternative alleles being numbered 1, 2, 3 etc. Note
          that a genotype can both be diploid (2 alleles, the normal situation)
          and haploid (certain situations, like germ cells, or men who have only
          1 X chromosome and 1 Y chromosome).
          
GenotypingData
          [Result? Info? Call?] The data gathered during the genotyping process,
          which may include a genotype, support for the several alleles, etc. 
          
MendelianQuality: object listing the number of occurrences of a certain class of
          events in which they are correct or incorrect.
          
Support   Object that lists the raw support for each allele. So may be 15,4,0,2 
          for the ref allele and the alt1, alt2 and alt3 alleles respectively.
